    "# Ceviche challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The ceviche challenges are based on \"[Inverse design of photonic devices with strict foundry fabrication constraints](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00313)\" by M. F. Schubert et al., and the associated [github repo](https://github.com/google/ceviche-challenges). These use the [ceviche](https://github.com/fancompute/ceviche) simulation engine to solve Maxwell's equations in two dimensions, and are therefore nonphysical and serve primarily as a vehicle for evaluating optimization schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges include a mode converter, beam splitter, waveguide bend, and wavelength demultiplexer, with a \"normal\" and \"lightweight\" version of each. Lightweight versions have lower simulation resolution and are faster to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll focus on the mode converter challenge---simulating an existing design, and showing how to set up an optimization problem that will give us a new mode converter. The mode converter was also studied in \"[Validation and characterization of algorithms and software for photonics inverse design](https://opg.optica.org/josab/ViewMedia.cfm?uri=josab-41-2-A161)\" by Chen et al.; the associated [photonics-opt-testbed repo](https://github.com/NanoComp/photonics-opt-testbed) contains several example designs."

    "Now, we'll create the `ceviche_mode_converter` challenge. Since we won't be optimizing just yet, we don't actually need the challenge itself, but rather it's `component` attribute. As stated in the readme, a component represents a physical structure to be optimized, and has some intended excitation or operating condition (e.g. illumination with a particular wavelength from a particular direction). The component includes methods to obtain initial parameters, and to compute the response of a component to the excitation."
